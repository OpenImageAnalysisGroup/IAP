/**
 * Interface for streaming a read-only collection of objects using rmi.
 * Interface mimics the Iterator interface, but allows for IOExceptions and
 * requires the implementation to be Serializable. This interface is useful
 * for situations where a collection is too large to be in memory all at once
 * and instead needs to be streamed to the consumer of the data. For example,
 * data could be read directly from a database and streamed to a remote object
 * using this utility. Generally, one would use the
 * RemoteIteratorClient/Server classes to implement the remote functionality.
 * <p>
 * Since this interface is built for use in a remote fashion, there is also a close() method to facilitate better resource management. Consumers of the iterator
 * should ensure that the close method is called one way or another (especially if the entire iteration is not consumed!), or resources may not be utilized as
 * efficiently on the server.
 * <p>
 * Note, implementations of this class are not required to be thread-safe.
