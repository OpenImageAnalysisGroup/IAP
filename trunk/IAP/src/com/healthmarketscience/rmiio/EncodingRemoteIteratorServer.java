/**
 * Base class for implementing the server side of a RemoteIterator where the
 * objects need to be encoded on the fly.  This object sends objects to the
 * RemoteIteratorClient through the internal RemoteInputStreamServer as
 * needed.  Implementations of this class must implement the writeNextObject()
 * method, which should write the next object in the iteration to the local
 * output stream (which in turn will forward to data to the
 * RemoteIteratorClient).  An Implementation should override closeIterator()
 * to do cleanup (like flushing and closing the output stream) after the last
 * object has been sent.  The local output stream must <b>only</b> be written
 * during a call to writeNextObject() or closeIterator().  Note, users of this
 * class should ensure that the close() method is called one way or another,
 * or shutdown of the process may be delayed.
 * <p>
 * Note, a real-time-ish iterator is available if compression is disabled and
 * noDelay is enabled (noDelay is ignored if compression is enabled).  This
 * will attempt to send objects across the wire ASAP, at the expense of more
 * wire traffic.
