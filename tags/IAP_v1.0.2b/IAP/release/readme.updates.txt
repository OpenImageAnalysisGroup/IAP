V1.0.2b (August 12, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Experiment header information about used storage space when saving to disk 
  (VFS) has been corrected
* Reduced memory usage during loading of data sets from MongoDB databases and
  from VFS
* Reduced memory usage during data analysis


V1.0.1 (July 26, 2013)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A problem has been fixed, which prevented the proper analysis of data sets, 
  loaded from a temporary VFS location (e.g. using the data set-loading command, 
  to access a local file system folder).
* Analysis blocks, used for Barley and Arabidopsis analysis have been moved to 
  their proper package locations (similar to the Maize analysis blocks).
