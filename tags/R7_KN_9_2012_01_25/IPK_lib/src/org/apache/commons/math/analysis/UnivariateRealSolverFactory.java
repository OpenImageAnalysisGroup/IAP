/**
 * Abstract factory class used to create {@link UnivariateRealSolver} instances.
 * <p>
 * Solvers implementing the following algorithms are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bisection</li>
 * <li>Brent's method</li>
 * <li>Secant method</li>
 * </ul>
 * Concrete factories extending this class also specify a default solver, instances of which are returned by <code>newDefaultSolver()</code>.
 * <p>
 * Common usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * SolverFactory factory = UnivariateRealSolverFactory.newInstance();
 * 
 * // create a Brent solver to use with a UnivariateRealFunction f
 * BrentSolver solver = factory.newBrentSolver(f);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/discovery/">Jakarta Commons Discovery</a> is used to determine the concrete factory returned by
 * <code>UnivariateRealSolverFactory.newInstance().</code> The default is {@link UnivariateRealSolverFactoryImpl}.
