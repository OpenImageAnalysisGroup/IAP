  LIGAND - Database of Chemical Compounds and Reactions in Biological Pathways

This directory contains the following files of the LIGAND database, Release
29.0. For more detailed information on each file, see the ligand.txt file.

File		Contents

ligand.txt	User manual of the LIGAND database.

compound	COMPOUND section of the LIGAND database.

mol.tar.Z	MDL mol file format compound structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files C?????.mol
		are created in the mol directory. C????? is the compound ID.

gif.tar.Z	GIF format compound structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files C?????.gif
		are created in the gif directory. C????? is the compound ID.

kcf.tar.Z	KCF format compound structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files C?????.kcf
		are created in the kcf directory. C????? is the compound ID.

merged_compound.lst
		List of merged compounds with the first column for the obsolete
		compound ID and the second coloumn for the currently used
		compound ID.

glycan		GLYCAN section of the LIGAND database.

glycan_gif.tar.Z
		GIF format glycan structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files G?????.gif
		are created in the glycan_gif directory.
		G????? is the glycan ID.

glycan_kcf.tar.Z
		KCF format glycan structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files G?????.kcf
		are created in the glycan_kcf directory.
		G????? is the glycan ID.

reaction	REACTION section of the LIGAND database.

reaction_gif.tar.Z
		GIF format reaction structure data.
		By uncompress and tar xvf commands, the files R?????.gif
		are created in the reaction_gif directory.
		R????? is the reaciton ID.

reaction_name.lst
		List of reactions extracted from the DEFINITION field of
		the REACTION section.

reaction.lst	List of reactions extracted from the EQUATION field of
		the REACTION section.

reaction_main.lst
		Almost the same as reaction.lst except that the compounds
		in each reaction are limited to the chemical compounds shown
		in the KEGG pathway diagrams, i.e. possibly main reactants.

reaction_mapformula.lst
		This file is a reformatting of the reaction_main.lst and
		includes links to pathway map IDs and direction information
		of each reaction. The arrow of each reaction is either =>,
		<=, or <=>.
		Please use this file instead of reaction_main.lst.
		reaction_main.lst will be obsolete or replaced with another
		information in near future.

enzyme		Enzyme section of the LIGAND database.

ECtable		Enzyme EC number classification table.
