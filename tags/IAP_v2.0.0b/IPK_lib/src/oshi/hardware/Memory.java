 * Memory refers to the state information of a computing system, as it is kept active in some physical 
 * structure. The term "memory" is used for the information in physical systems which are fast (ie. RAM),
 * as a distinction from physical systems which are slow to access (ie. data storage). By design, the term
 * "memory" refers to temporary state devices, whereas the term "storage" is reserved for permanent data.
