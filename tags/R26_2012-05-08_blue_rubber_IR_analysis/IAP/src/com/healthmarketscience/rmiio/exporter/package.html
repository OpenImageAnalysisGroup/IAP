<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<h3>RemoteStreamExporter</h3>

<p>
This class provides the base for integrating the remote streams into any RPC
framework.  The remote stream implementations utilize an instance of the
{@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.exporter.RemoteStreamExporter} to tie
them to the desired communication channel.  There are a variety of mechanisms
(explicit and implicit) for choosing which RemoteStreamExporter implementation
is used to tie a remote stream to an RPC framework.  The {@link com.healthmarketscience.rmiio.exporter.DefaultRemoteStreamExporter default}
implementation uitilizes RMI.
