/**
 * InputStream which facilitates generating a stream of data on demand through
 * some programmatic action. Subclasses must implement the {@link #encode} method, which should write some reasonable amount of data to the
 * OutputStream returned from {@link #createOutputStream} (which in turn will
 * forward to data to the consumer of the InputStream). The OutputStream
 * linked to this class must <b>only</b> be written during a call to <code>encode</code>.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, this class provides a "packet" based read method, which returns the underlying byte[]'s (which will be approximately the size of the chunk size
 * configured for this class), which may be more efficient in some applications.
 * <p>
 * Note, this class has no synchronization except that the <code>close</code> method supports asynchronous closing.
