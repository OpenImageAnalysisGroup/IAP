	 * Startmethod for Vanted. The Add-on will be loaded, if you specify the
	 * correct xml-file. Starting with more than one Add-on at the same time is
	 * not supported yet, but should be sufficient for most cases.
	 * <p>
	 * In the Add-on-Example.xml (which may be renamed if you want to) you can specify the description, version, ... for your Add-on. This information is used
	 * for the listing of your Add-on in the Add-on-Manager dialog. Additionally the Plugin-class is instantiated by entering the location
	 * (<main>example_addon.ExemplaryAddon</main> means that Vanted tries to find the class "ExemplaryAddon" in the package "example_addon") and instantiates it.
	 * <p>
	 * For startup you should also read the <code>readme.txt</code> (as usual).
	 * <p>
	 * For creating a jar of your add-on just use ant to start the <code>updateJar.xml</code>. It will also track your progress by copying the actual jar into an
	 * "old"-directory before overwriting, which can be used to start vanted with an older version of your add-on. But please don't forget to rename it again
	 * ("Add-on-Example(09-02-14).jar" -> "Add-on-Example.jar"), because otherwise vanted won't load the plugin. Note that the jar also contains the sourcecode.
